Hello Wallace, I'm glad to let you know that the asset is ready.

It was a pleasure work closy with you and your team. I'm sending this email to present your asset and describe it.

We developed a grid, a grid is a framework of spaced bars that are parallel to or cross each other. 
The grid contains 25 squares and we selected some squares and we added a yellow background and with the rest we kept a white color.

<img width="125" height="131" alt="Grid" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3577c261-9928-469e-906c-a8abd793e8b2" />


There are two buttons, the first one appears with the word "Start" and the second one with the word "Stop".

When the user press the Start button the asset will show a pop-up message with the instructions and it will start the interactive mode of the grid.

After closing the pop-up message with the instructions an image will appear radondly into a yellow square with also a random orientation, it could be horizontal or vertical as well.
When the user starts to look for the square that contains the picture, the asset will count each square where the user looked for the picture using the mouse.


*Picture that the user needs to find.*

If the user finds the picture, a pop-up message will automaticaly appear with the information of how many white and yellow squares has the user looked at until identify the square that contains the picture.

The user can restart the game pressing the Start button many times that he want.

If you have any question, feel free to reply to this email at your best convenience.
