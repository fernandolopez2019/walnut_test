Hello Wallace, I hope you are doing well.

Thank you for meeting with us and let us understand better what you are looking for your asset. I'm sending this email to follow up what we established in our meeting.

As we talked, we will develop this asset using web developing languages like **CSS**, **HTML** and **Javascript**.
We will create an interactive grid with some yellow and whites cells applying an hover effect, setting a picture in a random yellow cell for each time that the user press the Start button and counting the cells that the user will review before finding the cell with the picture.
The process of developing of this project will take two months and through this time you will receive deliverables about the asset.
