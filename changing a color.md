Hello Wallace, it's great that you know some Html code.

I'm sending this email to let you know how to change a specific color of your grid.
I'll start explaining a little about the structure of your asset. We developed your asset with Html, CSS and Javascript code.
The *Html* contains the elements of the asset, the *Javascript* contains the instructions and the *CSS* contains the style of the whole asset.

In the body section that begins with the keyword **body** we can identify the class of each element that we have for this asset. We established the style of the elements with CSS code, 
so it means that we can go to the Head section and identify the styles by finding the keyword **style** so you can change any color you want.

The squares of the grid are classified in two groups the wh for the squares with a white background and the yw for the yellow background.


After this explanation, I will show you how you can change the color of the elements of the asset following these few steps:

1. Into the **body** section we can look for the class of the element that you want to edit.

2. With that specific class we go to the **head** section and then to the **style** section.

3. In the **style** section we look for the class of the element that we want to edit, we will find the class after a "." and before a "{".

4. When you find the class of the element that you want to edit, we look for the command that defines the color,
   this command will specify which property of the element that color will be applied.

5. If you want to change the color of the square that appears when your asset loads, you need to change the class color without the word **hover**.

5.1 If you want to change the color of the square when the user pass the mouse hover over the square, you can change the class color with the word **hover**.

6. You can replace the style by changing the color that you want. You can change it using the color name, the rgba color code and also the hexadecimal code.
